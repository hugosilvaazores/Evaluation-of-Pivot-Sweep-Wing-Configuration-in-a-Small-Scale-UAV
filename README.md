This project was inspired by Robert T. Jones, a NASA Engineer at Ames Research Center, who resurrected the oblique wing concept first suggested by Richard Vogt in 1942. Though somewhat eccentric, the diagonal (or oblique) wing has the potential to be valuable due to its drag reduction capabilities in high-speed flight by allowing increased sweep angle and thus seems optimal for high-efficiency flight.
While it is archaeologically interesting this is a very challenging engineering undertaking involving asymmetric geometry and complex controls. This project will detail the design, building, and flight testing of a small-scale, flying prototype with a servo-actuated diagonal wing. The goal of this project will be to assess the mechanical feasibility and flight characteristics of the oblique-wing configuration, based on NASAâ€™s AD-1 proof-of-concept experimental airplane.
Central to this system is the concept and ability to combine wing sweep - with the evolution of angle of attack to keep lift, and stability while in flight when performing any reconfiguration. The goal of this project is to produce a proof-of-concept prototype that is flight-able, and built from ultra-simple and lightweight parts that can be tested at low-speed.
